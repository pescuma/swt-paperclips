Version 0.5.0
* BackgroundPrint - wrapper print that draws a background color behind it's
  target.
* net.sf.paperclips.decorator package - for defining and applying decorations
  without having to directly reference a constructor.
* WidePrint - wrapper print that allows prints too wide to fit on a page to be
  broken across several pages.
* Updated semantics of PrintPiece.dispose() to allow PrintPiece and
  BorderPainter re-use.  Anybody who writes their own Print classes should
  check out the javadocs for this method and update their code.
* GridPrint can now be configured with a column header that repeats on each
  page.  See the addHeader(...) methods.  The background color in column
  headers can be set using the setHeaderBackground(RGB) method.
* Fixed bug 1480013: illogical layout of grid rows when they are broken across
  pages.  Sometimes some content would be on the end of one page and the other
  content would be at the beginning of the next page.  This led to sometimes
  confusing printouts.  This fix essentially "glues" the row together so it
  doesn't get separated like this any more.

Version 0.4.3
* Bugfix: Whenever the print space available to a GridPrint was smaller than
  it's calculated minimum size, the grid would print larger than the available
  space, in certain cases. 

Version 0.4.2
* NoBreakPrint is a wrapper which prevents it's target print from being broken
  up between pages (or columns). 
* BreakPrint adds a page break or column break. 
* PaperClips sources are now version controlled through Subversion (finally!).

Version 0.4.1
* Bugfix: if a GridPrint is configured with a cell border and added to a
  ColumnPrint, an infinite loop will occur when attempting to print. 

Version 0.4.0
* All public API are documented in javadocs. 
* Custom cell borders in GridPrint - uses the same Border interface as
  BorderPrint.

Version 0.3 beta
* AlignPrint - vertical and horizontal alignment of a child print.
* ColumnPrint - lays out a child print into multiple columns.
* GapBorder - a blank border with configurable margin size (see API docs for
  BorderPrint)

Version 0.2 alpha
* PagePrint - page headers and footers (including page numbering)
* BorderPrint - decorating document elements with borders.
* LayerPrint - a layout element which renders document elements one above the
  other.

Version 0.1 alpha
Basic document elements:
* TextPrint - for printing text
* ImagePrint - for printing images
* LinePrint - for printing horizontal and (sometimes) vertical rules.
* GridPrint - arranges it's child prints into a grid.
* LayerPrint - displays it's child prints on top of eachother.
* SeriesPrint - displays multiple prints, one after another, with only one to
  a page.
* FactoryPrint - aids in composition of Prints.

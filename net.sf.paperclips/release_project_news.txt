PaperClips 1.0.3 released

Updates in this release:
* Bugs fixed:
  * Fixed integer overflow error in GridPrint which sometimes caused printing of very long strings to fail.
  * Fixed column size distribution in GridPrint when paper space is scarce.
* New Features
  * PrintPreview now supports lazy layout of print jobs.  This can be used to speed up previews of very large print jobs. 
* Changes:
  * Implement equals() and hashCode() in all Print objects.
  * Performance tuning in text and grid layouts
* Known issues:
  * PrintPreview issues a page feed whenever a PrintPreview control is disposed or changes printers.  This is due to missing API in GTK for cancelling a print job.
* Example snippets:
  * Snippet no longer implement Print.  This was an unnecessary detail and tends to confuse newcomers.

PaperClips is a simple, light weight, extensible printing library for SWT.  PaperClips hides the complexity of laying out and rendering documents on the printer, helping you to focus on what to print instead of how to print it.

In a nutshell, PaperClips provides an assortment of document "building blocks", which you can tweak and combine to form a document. The assembled document is then sent to PaperClips for printing. PaperClips includes built-in support for printing text, images, borders, headers and footers, column layouts and tabular (grid) layouts.  PaperClips is designed to be extensible, so you can code your own printable document elements.

PaperClips depends on the SWT library, a project of the Eclipse Foundation. The SWT library may be downloaded from the Eclipse site: http://www.eclipse.org/swt/

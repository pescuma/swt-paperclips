PaperClips 1.0.1 released

This is a maintenance release to address printing issues on Mac OS X.

Updates in this release:
* Resolved printing problems on Mac OS X.
* Added public accessor APIs for all Print classes.

PaperClips is a simple, light weight, extensible printing library for SWT.  PaperClips hides the complexity of laying out and rendering documents on the printer, helping you to focus on what you want to print instead of how you're going to print it.

In a nutshell, PaperClips provides an assortment of document "building blocks", which you can tweak and combine to form a document. The assembled document is then sent to PaperClips for printing. PaperClips includes built-in support for printing text, images, borders, headers and footers, column layouts and tabular (grid) layouts.  PaperClips is designed to be extensible, so you can code your own printable document elements.

PaperClips depends on the SWT library, a project of the Eclipse Foundation. The SWT library may be downloaded from the Eclipse site: http://www.eclipse.org/swt/

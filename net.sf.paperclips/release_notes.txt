Release 0.6.1:
* PrintPreview control:
  * ComputeSize is now implemented properly, which helps
    determine the proper sizing of the control depending on
    the viewing scale.  Snippet7 has been updated to
    demonstrate this feature.
  * The performance problems (read: major lags) when zooming
    in very close are resolved.  Go ahead, zoom to
    ridiculous levels with confidence!  We promise not to
    tell anyone.
  * Bugfix: page disappears after a call to setPrinterData.
* ColumnPrint behavior of compressing the last page of
  content to the minimum possible height can now be disabled
  using the "compressed" property.
* GridPrint now has addColumn and addColumns methods
  supporting column modifications after construction.  Some
  of the snippets were modified to use this new API.

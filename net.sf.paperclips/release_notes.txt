Version 1.0.3
* Bugs fixed:
  * Fixed integer overflow error in GridPrint which
    sometimes caused printing of very long strings to fail.
  * Fixed column size distribution in GridPrint when paper
    space is scarce.
* New Features
  * PrintPreview now supports lazy layout of print jobs.
    This can be used to speed up previews of very large
    print jobs. 
* Changes:
  * Implement equals() and hashCode() in all Print objects.
  * Performance tuning in text and grid layouts
  * Snippets no longer implement Print.  This was an
    unnecessary detail and tends to confuse newcomers.
* Known issues:
  * PrintPreview issues a page feed whenever a PrintPreview
    control is disposed or changes printers.  This is due
    to missing API in GTK for cancelling a print job.

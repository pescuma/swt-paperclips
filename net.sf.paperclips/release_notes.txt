Release 1.0.2
* Bugs fixed:
  * Clipping problems on Mac OS X.
  * PrintPreview.getPageCount() returns 0 before pages are
    first drawn.
  * PrintPreview spits out a blank page on Linux when the
    window is closed.
  * Changed ImageCaptureExample.java to capture JPG since
    PNG was not fully supported until SWT version 3.3
    (PaperClips is developed against 3.2).
  * BorderPrint sometimes showed an open bottom border
    even though the target was completely shown.
  * PrintViewer performance improvements when print
    document is vertically greedy.
* New Features:
  * GridPrint.setCellClippingEnabled() controls whether
    grid cells may be broken across pages.  See
    GridPrintCellClippingExample.java.
  * DefaultGridLook.setCellPadding()
  * PrintPreview.setHorizontalPageCount() and
    .setVerticalPageCount() controls how many pages are
    shown on screen.
  * Experimental PaperClips.setDebug() API helps
    troubleshoot documents that won't lay out properly
    ("Unable to layout on page X" errors).
  * BasicGridLookPainter simplifies implementing custom
    GridLooks.
  * StyledTextPrint for mixing text with different font
    sizes, styles, colors and decorations.  Other printable
    objects such as ImagePrint may be embedded inline with
    the text.
  * TextPrint and StyledTextPrint support underline and
    strikeout text.
  * TextPrint.setWordSplitting() controls whether words may
    be split between rows.  This feature only applies when
    space is very limited.
  * Unified error reporting to PaperClips.error() methods.
    Custom Print implementations should use these methods
    to act uniformly with the rest of the library. 
* Enhanced print preview snippet (Snippet7):
  * Support scrolling with the mouse wheel (horizontally
    with Shift+Wheel)
  * Support zooming with Ctrl+Wheel

Release 0.6.0:

Note: This release is API incompatible with previous 
releases.  The UI controls have been moved to a different 
package, and to a different plugin (net.sf.paperclips.ui). 
A simple search and replace should suffice to fix 
compilation problems.  I try to minimize changing APIs on 
everybody, I sincerely hope this doesn't cause a big 
problem.  However I believe that the improves clarity of the
API will pay dividends in the long run.

* JDK 1.4 compliance.
* New WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) PrintPreview
  control in the net.sf.paperclips.ui plugin.
* Other existing UI controls (in the net.sf.paperclips.swt
  package) have been moved to the net.sf.paperclips.ui,
  into the net.sf.paperclips.ui package.
* The PrintUtil class has been replaced with the PaperClips
  and PrintJob classes.
* The new PrintJob class holds information about the job
  name, document, page margins, and paper orientation.
* The new PaperClips class provides a simpler API for
  printing documents.
* The new Margins class provides fine control over margins
  on each edge of the paper.
* Deprecated package net.sf.paperclips.preview has been
  removed.

The example snippets were updated to use new APIs in
PaperClips.  Snippet7.java was added to demonstrate use of
the new PrintPreview control.

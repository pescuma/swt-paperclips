Release 1.0.1:
* Resolved printing problems on Mac OS X.
* Added public accessor APIs for all Print classes.

Release 1.0.0:
* Vertical cell alignment in GridPrint, including SWT.FILL
  alignment to allow embedding vertically greedy prints like
  SWT.VERTICAL ~LinePrints.
* SidewaysPrint - a non-greedy version of RotatePrint.  Very
  handy for putting sideways text in grids.
* TextPrint's and PageNumberPrint's horizontally greedy
  behavior had to be removed in order for SidewaysPrint to
  work correctly.  This will not cause any compilation
  problems, however you may see some unexpected layout
  behavior.
* Updated Snippet7 (print preview example) in examples
  plug-in to clean up some of the odd behavior when resizing
  the window in Fit-to-Width or Fit-to-Height mode.  Also
  added code for scrolling around the page using mouse drag.
* Bug fix: PaperClips.getPages() throws the wrong exception
  when a document fails to lay out properly.
* Bug fix: PrintPreview does not redraw when setScale is
  called to change the display scale.
* Bug fix: Headers/footers in a PagePrint do not display any
  contents after the page number.

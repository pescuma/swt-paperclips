Release 0.5.4:

* Bugfix: GridPrint fails to generate last page if the
  final row of content finishes on previous page, but there
  was only enough room to print an open bottom border.
  (This bug was discovered trying to run Snippet4)
* Added SimplePageDecoration, a simple wrapper for static
  page headers and footers.  This class can be used in lieu
  of creating a custom PageDecoration class for simple page
  numbering.
* The DefaultPageNumberFormat class (the default
  PageNumberFormat class used by PageNumberPrint) is now a
  top-level, public class.
* Added SimplePageDecoration class, a PageDecoration which
  displays a Print you provide on each page.

The example snippets were updated to use new APIs in
PrintUtil.  Snippet6.java was added to demonstrate use of
PagePrint.

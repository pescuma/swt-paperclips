Release 0.5.3:

This release fixes a semantic error introduced in 0.5.2:
* TextPrint - was modified to be horizontally greedy in
  version 0.5.2.  This behavior is not appropriate for
  left-aligned text (the default alignment), as it
  effectively negates the column alignment in a GridPrint
  cells.  Therefore as of 0.5.3, center- and right-aligned
  text is horizontally greedy, whereas left-aligned text is
  not.

Release 0.5.2:

This release adds some features and fixes a few bugs:
* CellBackgroundProvider interface - an interface for
  programmatic control of the background color in each grid
  cell.  Default implementation is provided in the
  DefaultBackgroundProvider class.
* DefaultGridLook - now supports control of the header,
  body, and footer background colors using either
  setHeaderBackground(RGB) or
  setHeaderBackgroundProvider(CellBackgroundProvider).
* Prints with greedy layout behavior now have documentation
  indicating the behavior in the javadocs.
* Bugfix to GridPrint which sometimes cause grids to overlap
  with other prints.

The example snippets were updated to use new APIs in
PrintUtil.  Snippet6.java was added to demonstrate use of
PagePrint.

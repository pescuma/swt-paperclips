  * [http://www.netcat.li/java-report-printing-library ReportCat Printing Library] - (I am not affiliated with ReportCat)  The PaperClips API was inspired by and in many instances closely resembles the excellent ReportCat library.  ReportCat is a commercial printing library which prints using the java.awt.printing package in the core J2SE distribution.  If you have a Java project which needs printing capabilities, but SWT is not an option, I highly recommend this library.  It was money well spent on my project (before I switched to [SWT]).
